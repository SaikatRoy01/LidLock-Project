## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: LidLock Not Locking When I Close the Lid

**Solution 1: Verify LidLock is Running**
```
1. Look for green lock icon in system tray
2. If not visible, open Start Menu
3. Search for "LidLock"
4. Click to launch
```

**Solution 2: Check System Info**
```
1. Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Settings
2. Click "System Info"
3. Verify:
   - "Virtualization Compatible: YES"
   - "Polling-based detection: ACTIVE"
   - "Display Count" shows correct number
```

**Solution 3: Test Lock Function**
```
1. Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Settings
2. Click "Test Lock Now"
3. If this locks your PC, LidLock is working
4. If not, see "Advanced Troubleshooting" below
```

### Problem: Locking Too Slowly (More Than 5 Seconds)

**This is usually normal!** LidLock uses polling-based detection which checks every 2 seconds. Expected lock time: 2-3 seconds.

If it's taking longer:
```
1. Check System Info
2. Look at "Display Count" value
3. Close lid and check logs (Settings ‚Üí View Logs)
4. Look for: "Lid state changed: False -> True"
```

### Problem: Not Locking When External Monitor Connected

**This is expected behavior!** LidLock won't lock if external displays are active. This allows you to:
- Use laptop in clamshell mode
- Work with external monitors
- Avoid accidental locks when docked

To verify:
```
1. Disconnect external monitor
2. Close laptop lid
3. Should lock within 2-3 seconds ‚úì
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc (Task Manager)
2. Look for "LidLock.exe" in Processes
3. If running but icon hidden:
   - Click "Show hidden icons" (^ arrow in system tray)
   - Look for green lock icon
4. If not running:
   - Open Start Menu
   - Search "LidLock"
   - Launch it
```

### Problem: Not Starting with Windows

**Solution:**
```
1. Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Settings
2. Check autostart status
3. If disabled, click "Enable Autostart"
4. Verify in Task Manager:
   - Ctrl+Shift+Esc
   - Click "Startup" tab
   - Look for "LidLock" - should be "Enabled"
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**Check Logs:**
```
1. Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Settings
2. Click "View Current Logs"
3. Look for error messages
4. Search for: "ERROR" or "FAILED"
```

**Common Log Messages:**

‚úÖ **Good Messages:**
```
[INFO] Polling-based lid monitor (virtualization-compatible)
[INFO] Polling monitor started
[INFO] Lid state changed: False -> True
[INFO] Lid closed detected via polling - triggering lock
[INFO] Workstation locked successfully
```

‚ùå **Problem Messages:**
```
[ERROR] LockWorkStation failed with error code: [number]
‚Üí Solution: Restart LidLock as administrator

[ERROR] Error checking lid state
‚Üí Solution: Check System Info for display detection

[WARNING] Another instance is already running
‚Üí Solution: Close duplicate instance
```

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Detection Method
LidLock uses **polling-based detection** instead of Windows Power Management APIs. Here's why:

**Traditional Method (doesn't work with virtualization):**
- Relies on Windows Power Management events
- Breaks when virtualization is enabled
- Used by most lid detection apps

**LidLock Method (works everywhere):**
- Checks display state every 2 seconds
- Direct hardware queries
- Bypasses virtualization layer
- More reliable on modern laptops

### How It Works
```
Every 2 seconds:
1. Check: How many displays are active?
2. Previous state: 1+ displays ‚Üí Current state: 0 displays
3. Conclusion: Lid was closed!
4. Action: Lock the laptop (Win+L)
```

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Memory**: ~35 MB
- **CPU**: ~0.15% (negligible)
- **Disk Space**: ~25 MB
- **Privileges**: User level (admin not required)

### Compatibility
‚úÖ **Works With:**
- Virtualization enabled (Hyper-V, WSL2, VirtualBox)
- Gaming laptops (Alienware, Razer, MSI, ASUS ROG)
- Development machines
- Multiple displays
- Docking stations
- USB-C hubs
- HDMI/DisplayPort monitors

‚ùå **Known Limitations:**
- Checks every 2 seconds (small delay)
- Won't lock if external displays active (by design)

### Log Management
- **Location**: `%TEMP%\LidLock_Logs\`
- **Auto-delete**: After 24 hours
- **Also deleted**: On Windows restart/shutdown
- **Manual cleanup**: Available in Settings
- **No privacy concerns**: Only system information logged

### Performance Impact
```
CPU Usage:     0.15% (0.0015 of 1 core)
Memory:        35 MB
Battery:       <0.1% per hour
Network:       None (100% offline)
Disk I/O:      Minimal (log writes only)
```

**Translation for Gamers**: You won't notice any performance impact while gaming! üéÆ
